Chris was working on a recipe app when he was called away to work on another project.
Your assignment is to finish the app, Chris left some TODOs in the code that might help you complete the project.

- the recipes list will eventually be a db, but for now it's an object of arrays in AllRecipes in the Recipes folder
- the page should load with the names of the recipes so a user can click on them to see the recipe
- when the user selects a recipe, the app should load data from the recipe api and display the recipe details on the page

Finish that immediate task and if you still have time then here are some notes from the team that might give you a more challenging assignment:

- Dan rightfully noted that AllRecipes does too much to be called a model. He suggested that the functionality in AllRecipes would make a good service that could be dependency injected into the appropriate controllers.
- Eric is hoping to demo the project on Friday, and would like the ability to add new recipes to the list of recipes. He'd love some sort of control that allows him to add to the in memory list of recipes.

Finish as much as you are comfortable with doing in a reasonable amount of time.

You are also encouraged to make suggestions on anything Chris might have improved in the code.
You can refactor anything you like, but please give a little explanation as to why your code is an improvement.
